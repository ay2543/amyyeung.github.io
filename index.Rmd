## About me
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/headshot.jpg" style="width:30%"></p>




**Who I am:** A second-year Master of Public Health student at Columbia, passionate about using data to understand patterns and make decisions in the health industry. Originally from Hong Kong.

**Things I care about:** Data-driven solutions, health equity, transparent communication, constructive feedback, interdisciplinary collaboration

**How I do things:** I start at the core (making sure I understand the fundamentals), then branch outwards, while consistently communicating my progress and exchanging feedback. Usually on the hunt for more efficient/innovative approaches.

**Other things I enjoy:** Yoga, meditation, learning about the life stories of strangers
