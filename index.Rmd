**Who I am:** A second-year Master of Public Health student at Columbia, passionate about using data to understand patterns and make decisions in the health industry. Originally from Hong Kong.

**Things I care about:** Data-driven solutions, health equity, transparent communication, constructive feedback, interdisciplinary collaboration

**How I do things:** I start with the fundamentals (making sure I understand everything), then branch outwards. Once I start, I won't stop until I'm satisfied.

**Other things I enjoy:** Yoga, meditation, learning about the life stories of strangers
